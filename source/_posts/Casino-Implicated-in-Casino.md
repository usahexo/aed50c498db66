#  Casino Implicated in Casino

The owners of a casino in Oklahoma have been implicated in a casino scheme. Federal prosecutors claim that the casino owners helped funnel money to a Native American tribe with ties to organized crime.

The scheme is said to have netted the casino owners over $20 million. Prosecutors allege that the money was used to bribe tribal leaders and help them gain control of the gambling operation.

In court filings, federal prosecutors said that the casino owners “committed egregious violations of federal law”. They are seeking to have the casino shut down permanently and the owners barred from ever owning or operating a gambling facility.

The casino, which has been in operation for over a decade, has denied any wrongdoing. In a statement, the casino said that it is cooperating with the investigation and looks forward to clearing its name.

This is not the first time that allegations of corruption have been made against this casino. In 2015, two former managers were charged with embezzling $1 million from the business.

#  Numbers Continue to Favor Blackjack Players at the Casino

In spite of the house edge, blackjack players have been winning more hands at the casino in recent years. In 2015, blackjack players enjoyed a signifcant advantage over the house, winning 54 percent of all hands played. The proft margin for blackjack players has continued to grow in the years since, reaching 59 percent in 2017.

What’s behind this trend? Part of the answer may lie in the growing popularity of blackjack-focused online casinos and gaming apps. These sites and apps allow players to hone their skills and learn game strategies before risking real money at a brick-and-mortar casino.

#  The Risks of Playing Blackjack at a Live Casino

It’s no secret that blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world. What’s not so well known, however, is that playing blackjack at a live casino can be quite risky. Here are four reasons why:

When you play blackjack at a live casino, you’re surrounded by other players and hustling dealers. This can easily lead to you losing control and making bad decisions.

2. The house edge is high

The house edge on blackjack is around 1%, which means that the casino has a better chance of winning than you do. This increases the risk of losing money when playing blackjack at a live casino.

3. It’s easy to make mistakes

Making mistakes is common when playing blackjack at a live casino, especially if you’re new to the game. These mistakes can quickly lead to losses.

4. You can easily get carried away

When you’re playing blackjack at a live casino, it’s easy to get carried away and start betting more money than you can afford to lose. This can lead to serious financial problems down the line.
