#  Monaco remains undefeated, leads Ligue 1 with a perfect record

With nine games played in the season, Monaco sits on top of the Ligue 1 table with a perfect record. This is especially impressive given that they are competing against some of Europe's biggest clubs, including Paris Saint-Germain and Marseille.

What has been behind Monaco's success this season? One of the main reasons is their strong defence. So far, they have only conceded two goals in the league, both in their match against Strasbourg. Another reason is their attacking prowess; they have scored 18 goals in nine games, making them one of the most potent sides in Europe.

One of the stars of Monaco's team is striker Radamel Falcao. The Colombian has been in superb form this season, scoring 10 goals in nine games. He is currently the top scorer in Ligue 1 and is well on his way to breaking his own personal best for a French league season.

Falcao is not the only player contributing to Monaco's impressive attack; there are also several other dangerous players, such as Brazilian winger Gonçalo Guedes and Belgian midfielder Youri Tielemans. These players have been able to score goals and create chances for their teammates, which has led to Monaco being one of the most feared sides in Europe.

So far, Monaco has been successful in all competitions they have participated in this season. They are currently leading Ligue 1 by four points and are through to the semi-finals of the French Cup. They will also be competing in the Champions League this year, where they will be looking to make it past the group stage for the first time since 2004/05.

Can Monaco continue their unbeaten run and win their first trophy since 2003/04? Only time will tell, but they certainly have a good chance of doing so with their current form.

#  PSG falls to 2nd after a loss to Lyon

Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) fell from first to second in the French Ligue 1 after losing to Lyon 2-1. The sudden fall happened just a few days after PSG's championship win against Monaco.

PSG took the lead in the first half with a goal by Kylian Mbappé in the 36th minute, but Lyon equalized in the 71st minute with a goal by Nabil Fekir. Memphis Depay then scored the winning goal for Lyon in the 90th minute.

The defeat means that PSG is now 4 points behind league leader and rival Marseille, with 2 games in hand. PSG still has a chance to win the championship, but will need to win its remaining games and hope that Marseille loses some of its matches.

Lyon is currently in 5th place in the French league, but could still make it into Europe's Champions League next season if it wins the French cup competition.

#  Marseille climbs up to 3rd after a win against Angers

Marseille climbed up to the third position in the Ligue 1 table, after a hard-fought 2-0 win against Angers SCO. Dimitri Payet and Florian Thauvin scored for the home side in the first and second half respectively, to seal all three points for Rudi Garcia’s side. Marseille are now level on points with Lyon, who occupy the second spot, while runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain continue to lead with 69 points.

The first chance of the game fell to Marseille as Diego Costa was released down the right flank by Lucas Ocampos, but his low cross was turned behind for a corner by Abdoulaye Mangane. The home side took the lead in the 17th minute courtesy of Dimitri Payet. Luiz Gustavo played a delightful ball over the top of the defense for Payet, who volleyed it past Ludovic Butelle into the back of the net.

Angers came close to equalizing just before halftime as Flavien Tait’s effort from outside the penalty area rattled the crossbar. However, Marseille doubled their lead in stoppage time through Florian Thauvin. The Frenchman latched onto a long ball from Morgan Sanson before firing past Butelle into the bottom corner.

Angers pressed for a goal in the second half but were unable to break down Marseille’s defense. Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa had a good chance to make it 3-0 for Marseille late on but his header sailed over the crossbar. The result means that Marseille have closed the gap on Lyon and are now just one point behind them in third place.

#  Monaco's lead at the top cut down to 4 points after PSG's win

After Monaco's surprise 2-1 home loss to Strasbourg on Saturday, they now lead PSG by only 4 points. Monaco had been in scintillating form up until this game, with only 1 defeat in their last 22 games in all competitions. However, goals from Pablo Martinez and Dimitri Lienard inflicted a first home league defeat of the season on Leonardo Jardim's side.

This result opens up the title race again, after PSG's victory cut Monaco's lead at the top to 7 points a fortnight ago. With both sides still having to face each other, it is still very much all to play for in terms of who will be crowned champions come the end of the season.

However, given Monaco's impressive form up until this game, they are still favourites to win the title despite their 4-point deficit. In addition, they also have a game in hand over PSG. With Edinson Cavani ruled out for the rest of the season and Neymar yet to truly find his best form since arriving at the club, Monaco may well have too much for Unai Emery's side over two legs when they meet in the Champions League latter stages.

#  Monaco still in the lead but only 2 points ahead of PSG

Three rounds of Ligue 1 have been played and Monaco is still in the lead, but PSG is getting closer. The first round ended with Monaco in the lead and PSG in second place. The second round resulted in a tie between the two teams, with Monaco maintaining its lead. The most recent round, on September 17th, went to PSG with a score of 2-1.

Even though Monaco has been losing points to PSG lately, it’s still in the lead with 27 points. PSG is following close behind with 25 points. Nice is currently in third place with 18 points. Considering the results so far this season, it seems that Monaco and PSG are the main contenders for first and second place. However, as we know from experience, anything can happen in football (or soccer). So far no other team has been able to earn as many points as Monaco or PSG.

The next round of Ligue 1 will be on September 24th, and it should be very exciting to see if Monaco can maintain its lead or if PSG will take over first place. In any case, it’s clear that these two teams are the dominant forces in the French league this year.
