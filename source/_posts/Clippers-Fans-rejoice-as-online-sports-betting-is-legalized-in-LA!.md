#  Clippers Fans rejoice as online sports betting is legalized in LA!

Clippers fans were seen cheering and celebrating in the streets Tuesday night as news broke that online sports betting had been legalized in the state of California.

“I can’t believe it!” exclaimed lifelong Clippers fan TJ McMillan. “This is huge! We can finally bet on our team and make some serious money!”

Others in the city seemed to share McMillan’s enthusiasm, with many taking to social media to express their joy at the news.

“FINALLY!” wrote one fan on Twitter. “Online sports betting is now legal in LA! Time to make some money off my favorite team!”

The passage of Prop. 64, which allows for legal, licensed sports betting within the state, has been seen as a major win by many in the gambling community. It opens up the possibility for billions of dollars in revenue to be generated each year from sports betting, with much of that money expected to flow into the coffers of local casinos and sports teams.

For Clippers fans like McMillan, it could also mean big profits – especially if his team can continue its winning ways and make a deep playoff run this season.

So far there has been no word on when exactly online sports betting will be made available in California, but industry insiders are predicting that it could be up and running within the next few months.
