#  What is the Botswana?

The Republic of Botswana is a landlocked country located in Southern Africa. The country is bordered by Namibia to the northwest, Zimbabwe to the northeast, Zambia to the east and South Africa to the south. It has a total area of 581,730 square kilometers and a population of over 2 million people. The official languages of Botswana are English and Setswana.

The area that is now Botswana was first inhabited by Khoisan hunter-gatherers more than 100,000 years ago. The first known inhabitants of the region were the San people, who still inhabit parts of Botswana today. Dutch traders reached the area in 1602, but it wasn't until 1853 that Europeans began to explore the interior of Southern Africa. In 1868, British missionaries arrived in the region and established a mission station at Kuruman.

In 1885, Cecil Rhodes founded the British South Africa Company and obtained a concession from Lobengula, king of the Ndebele people, to mine minerals in what is now Zimbabwe. Many settlers followed Rhodes to Southern Africa, including British troops sent to protect his interests. In 1895, British forces defeated the Ndebele and Mashona people in what is now Zimbabwe and established control over the region. In 1966, Britain granted independence to its African colonies and southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) became an independent republic.

The Bechuanaland Protectorate (now Botswana) remained under British rule until it gained independence on September 30, 1966. The country's first president was Seretse Khama, leader of the Bechuanaland Democratic Party (BDP). The BDP won every election until 1994 when it lost to the Botswana National Front (BNF). In 1999, Khama's son Ian succeeded him as president after winning an election against BNF candidate Festus Mogae. Mogae served as president from 1999 until 2008, when he was replaced by current president Ian Khama.

Botswana has been one of Africa's most stable countries since gaining independence in 1966. The country has had two peaceful changes of government and has never experienced a military coup or civil war. Economically, Botswana has done well since 1960s thanks largely to its diamonds resources. GDP growth averaged 5% between 1965 and 1998, making it one of the highest-growth economies in sub-Saharan Africa during that period...
