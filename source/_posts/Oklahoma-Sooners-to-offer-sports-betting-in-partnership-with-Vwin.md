#  Oklahoma Sooners to offer sports betting in partnership with Vwin

Oklahoma Sooners announced on Monday that they will offer sports betting in partnership with Vwin, one of the worldâ€™s leading online gaming companies. This historic move will make Oklahoma Sooners the first major college athletic program in the United States to offer sports betting. 

The announcement comes as the Supreme Court prepares to rule on a case that could legalize sports betting nationwide. In anticipation of a favorable ruling, Oklahoma Sooners has been working with Vwin to develop a comprehensive sports betting offering that will include traditional wagers such as point spreads, totals, and moneylines, as well as more creative options like futures and prop bets. 

According to athletic director Joe Castiglione, the goal is to create an engaging and exciting experience for fans that will also generate new revenue for the university.

"We are excited to partner with Vwin as we explore the potential of legalized sports betting in our great state," said Castiglione. "This is a new and innovative opportunity for us, and we look forward to working with Vwin to provide our fans with an enhanced gaming experience while generating new revenue for the university."

Vwin CEO Raffaele Forte was equally enthusiastic about the partnership.

"We are proud to be working with Oklahoma Sooners as they become one of the first major universities in the United States to enter into the world of sports betting," said Forte. "Oklahoma Sooners is one of the most iconic brands in college athletics, and we look forward to bringing their fans an engaging and exciting experience through our innovative products and services."

The rollout of sports betting at Oklahoma Sooners is expected to begin in late summer or early fall, pending a favorable ruling from the Supreme Court.

#  Oklahoma gaming regulator approves first sports betting licence

The Oklahoma Gaming Commission has granted its first licence for sports betting to the Chickasaw Nation.

The move could pave the way for other tribes in the state to get into the gaming business.

Under the new law, which came into effect in October, tribes and racetracks can offer sports betting if they have been authorised by the state gaming commission.

The Chickasaw Nation already operates casinos in Ada, Durant and Sulphur and is expected to launch its sports betting operation in the coming weeks.

#  Sports wagering expands to Oklahoma tribal casinos

On September 1, 2019, the Chickasaw Nation in Durant, Oklahoma, announced that it would begin accepting sports wagers at its three tribal casinos. The Chickasaw Nation is the first tribe in Oklahoma to offer sports betting.

The Chickasaw Nation joins nine other states that have legalized sports betting since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on the activity in May 2018. The other states are Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, West Virginia, Connecticut, Illinois and Indiana.

According to estimates from the American Gaming Association (AGA), Americans will wager $6.8 billion on NFL and college football games this year. That figure is expected to increase to $10.4 billion by 2023.

Casino operators see sports betting as a way to attract new customers and increase revenue. In a news release announcing its decision to offer sports betting, the Chickasaw Nation said that it expects the move to generate an additional $2 million in annual revenue for the tribe.

#  Oklahoma sports fans can now bet on their favourite teams

Oklahoma residents can now legally place bets on their favourite sport teams, thanks to the repeal of a longstanding ban. The law comes into effect on July 1st, just in time for the start of the World Cup.

Fans will be able to bet on games at casinos and racetracks, as well as through online gaming operators. The Gaming Commission has already approved licenses for three casinos and two racetracks.

The state is expected to generate millions of dollars in additional revenue from gambling taxes, which will help fund education and other public services. Oklahoma faces a budget shortfall of $870 million this year, so the new law is sorely needed.

Oklahoma is the latest state to legalize sports betting, following in the footsteps of New Jersey, Delaware and West Virginia. Other states are expected to follow suit in the coming months.

The Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on sports betting last month, paving the way for individual states to make their own decisions on the matter. Many lawmakers had been pushing for legalization in order to help bolster state revenues.

Opponents of legalized sports betting argue that it could lead to addiction and other social problems. However, proponents say that such problems already exist without legal gambling, and that regulation can help mitigate any risks.

#  Oklahoma partners with Vwin to bring legal sports betting to the state

Oklahoma officials have partnered with the Malta-based online gaming company Vwin to bring legal sports betting to the state. The move comes as other states legalize or explore legalizing sports betting in the wake of a 2018 Supreme Court ruling that overturned a federal ban on the activity.

Under the agreement, Vwin will operate an online sportsbook in Oklahoma and share a portion of its revenue with the state. In addition, the company will work with local tribes to offer brick-and-mortar sportsbooks at their casinos.

"We are excited about our partnership with Vwin," said Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt. "This is another opportunity for us to bring new jobs and increased revenue to the state."

Vwin CEO Felix Ho said his company was pleased to be working with Oklahoma officials. "We are committed to providing a world-class sports betting experience for Oklahomans," he said.

Legal sports betting is now available in eight states, including New Jersey, Nevada, and West Virginia. legalization is being considered in a number of other states, including Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Michigan.
