What do you think about this new development? Will other teams start copying Flamengo’s tactics, or will they stay away from blackjack and stick with more traditional methods? Let us know in the comments!

"It's a way of showing our support for the team and hopefully giving them an extra edge on the field," said one dealer.

The casino where the Flamengo dealers work is not the only one to be contributing money to football clubs; other casinos in Brazil have been doing likewise. In fact, over $1 million has been donated to teams across Brazil so far this year.
