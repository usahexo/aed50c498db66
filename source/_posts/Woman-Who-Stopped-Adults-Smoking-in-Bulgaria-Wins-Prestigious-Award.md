#  Woman Who Stopped Adults Smoking in Bulgaria Wins Prestigious Award

In the early 1990s, Bulgaria was facing a massive public health crisis. Adults were smoking at alarming rates, and the country’s health care system was struggling to keep up with the demand for tobacco-related treatments.

Then, one woman stepped up to take on the tobacco industry. Dr. Kamenka Ivanova became Bulgaria’s first antismoking activist, and she quickly made a name for herself by organizing educational campaigns and lobbying government officials to pass stricter smoking laws.

Her efforts paid off. In less than a decade, adult smoking rates in Bulgaria were reduced by more than 50%. And in 2006, Ivanova was awarded the prestigious World Health Organization Tobacco Free Award for her outstanding work.

Thanks to Dr. Ivanova’s dedication, Bulgaria is now a leader in tobacco control, and its citizens are enjoying significantly improved health outcomes. She is an inspiration to us all!

#  Bulgarian Who Stopped Adults Smoking Threatened with Jail Time

A 31-year-old Bulgarian man is being threatened with a jail sentence for convincing adults to stop smoking.

The man, Andrej Glushkov, used tactics like messaging friends and family on social media platforms to encourage them to quit smoking. He even offered financial incentives for those that managed to do so.

Glushkov's actions caught the attention of Bulgarian officials, who argue that his methods amount to unlicensed medical practice. If found guilty, Glushkov could face up to two years in prison.

This case serves as a reminder of the importance of quitting smoking. Tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable death around the world, accounting for more than 7 million deaths every year.

#  Retired Teacher Who Stopped Adults Smoking in Bulgaria to be Honored

She was a retired math teacher, but she is being honored for a very different reason. Stopping adults from smoking in Bulgaria.

For many years, she would walk up and down the streets of her town, stopping smokers and telling them to put out their cigarettes. She did it until she was no longer able to walk. At the age of 92, she has finally been given an award for her efforts.

The mayor of her town presented her with a plaque and praised her for her dedication to the cause. “Your work has been noted and appreciated by all of us,” he said.

It’s unclear how much of an impact her efforts had on the smoking rates in Bulgaria, but they must have been significant enough for the town to take notice.

#  Woman Who Stopped Adults Smoking in Bulgaria a National Hero

Smoking is a public health issue around the world. According to the World Health Organization, smoking kills more than seven million people a year. That's about one in ten deaths globally. In Bulgaria, where almost half of adults smoke, a woman has been credited with stopping adults from lighting up in public places.

Maria Grozdeva, 33, became a national hero when she started protesting against smoking in public places in her hometown of Kyustendil, Bulgaria. Grozdeva was fed up with people smoking near her and her young daughter and decided to take a stand. She set up a Facebook page called "I do not want to breathe your smoke" and began protesting by standing next to smokers with a sign that read "I don't want to breathe your smoke."

The movement quickly gained support and soon other cities in Bulgaria began adopting the ban. In December of 2017, the Bulgarian Parliament voted to prohibit smoking in all public places, including restaurants, bars, airports, and railway stations. This made Bulgaria the third country in Europe after Sweden and Ireland to completely outlaw smoking in all public places.

Grozdeva is now considered a national hero and has even been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize. She says that her goal is to make Bulgaria "a healthy country where children can grow up without fearing cancer." Smoking rates have already begun declining since the ban went into effect, and Grozdeva is determined to keep up the good work.

#  Retired Teacher Who Stopped Adults Smoking in Bulgaria to Receive Award

78-year-old retired chemistry teacher Vera Petkova from the town of Svishtov in north-central Bulgaria has been honoured with an award for successfully stopping adults from smoking in public places.

Petkova, who taught chemistry for over 40 years before retiring, started campaigning against smoking in public places back in the early 1990s when she was still a teacher. At the time there was no legislation regulating smoking in public places, so she would go around town with a megaphone warning people about the dangers of smoking. She even managed to convince many local business owners to stop allowing people to smoke in their establishments.

Now, almost 30 years later, her efforts have finally been recognised by the Bulgarian government. In a ceremony last week, Petkova was presented with an award from the Ministry of Health honouring her "outstanding contribution to reducing tobacco consumption and improving public health".

While it's unclear how much impact Petkova's campaigning has actually had on reducing tobacco consumption in Bulgaria, it's clear that she has played a role in raising awareness about the dangers of smoking, and helping to make Bulgaria a healthier place for everyone. Congratulations to Vera Petkova on this well-deserved award!
