        <h1 id="New-Jersey-Poised-to-be-the-Next-Major-Battleground-in-Sports-Wagering"><a href="#New-Jersey-Poised-to-be-the-Next-Major-Battleground-in-Sports-Wagering" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey Poised to be the Next Major Battleground in Sports Wagering"></a>New Jersey Poised to be the Next Major Battleground in Sports Wagering</h1><p>As the US Supreme Court weighs a case that could legalize sports gambling nationwide, New Jersey is preparing for a influx of new business. The Garden State has been at the forefront of the movement to legalize sports betting, with Governor Phil Murphy recently signing a bill that would authorize casinos and racetracks in the state to offer sports wagers.</p>
<p>If the Supreme Court rules in favor of New Jersey, it would overturn the federal ban on sports gambling that has been in place since 1992. The implications of such a ruling would be far-reaching, as 32 states currently have laws prohibiting sports betting.</p>
<p>New Jersey is eager to tap into what is projected to be a $150 billion market. Casino operators and others who stand to benefit from legalized sports betting are pouring money into lobbying efforts, hoping to get a piece of the action.</p>
<p>The NFL, NBA, MLB and other professional leagues are opposed to legalized sports betting, fearing that it will compromise the integrity of their games. They argue that it will create an uneven playing field and increase the chances for cheating. But supporters of legalization say that it can be regulated effectively and will generate revenue for states and businesses.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court is expected to issue its ruling in the coming weeks. If New Jersey wins, it could soon become one of the most popular places in the country for people to gamble on sporting events.</p>
<h1 id="NJ-Gov-Christie-Ready-to-Sign-Bill-Legalizing-Sports-Wagering"><a href="#NJ-Gov-Christie-Ready-to-Sign-Bill-Legalizing-Sports-Wagering" class="headerlink" title="NJ Gov. Christie Ready to Sign Bill Legalizing Sports Wagering"></a>NJ Gov. Christie Ready to Sign Bill Legalizing Sports Wagering</h1><p>The bill legalizing sports wagering in New Jersey was passed by the state legislature on Monday and is expected to be signed into law by Governor Chris Christie this week.</p>
<p>“I’m happy that we are finally able to get this done for the people of New Jersey,” Christie said in a statement. “I’m grateful to the legislature for their hard work on this issue, and I look forward to signing the bill into law.”</p>
<p>The move opens up a new stream of revenue for the cash-strapped state, with sports betting expected to bring in an estimated $10 million in its first year. Christie has said he will use the money to help plug a $1.6 billion budget shortfall.</p>
<p>Under the bill, casinos and racetracks will be allowed to offer sports betting, but only after receiving approval from state regulators. The casinos are also required to pay an 8 percent tax on their total sports bets, while racetracks will pay 12 percent.</p>
<p>Gamblers will be able to bet on professional and college games, as well as other sporting events such as NASCAR races and World Cup soccer matches.</p>
<p>The legalization of sports betting had long been sought by New Jersey officials, who argued that it would bring jobs and revenue to the state. But the efforts ran into opposition from major leagues like the NBA and NFL, which argue that gambling could compromise the integrity of their games.</p>
<p>A federal appeals court last year ruled against New Jersey, upholding a 1992 law that banned sports betting in all but four states. The state then took its case to the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed to hear it earlier this year.</p>
<h1 id="New-Jersey-Moves-One-Step-Closer-to-Legalizing-Sports-Wagering"><a href="#New-Jersey-Moves-One-Step-Closer-to-Legalizing-Sports-Wagering" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey Moves One Step Closer to Legalizing Sports Wagering"></a>New Jersey Moves One Step Closer to Legalizing Sports Wagering</h1><p>In another sign that the legal landscape for sports betting is changing, New Jersey lawmakers passed a bill on Monday that would allow the state to offer betting on professional and collegiate sporting events.</p>
<p>The measure, which now goes to Governor Chris Christie for his signature, would authorize New Jersey’s casinos and racetracks to accept bets on games. It would also create a new division within the state’s lottery department to regulate and oversee sports betting.</p>
<p>If Christie signs the bill into law, New Jersey would become the second state after Nevada to offer legal sports betting. Delaware also has a limited system in place that allows parlay betting on National Football League games.</p>
<p>Supporters of legalized sports betting say it would generate millions of dollars in revenue for the state government, as well as help bolster the struggling casino and racetrack industries.</p>
<p>Opponents, including major league sports leagues and the NCAA, argue that wagering on sports could lead to game-fixing and other corruption. They have also raised concerns about how gambling might affect children and teens.</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, momentum seems to be building in favor of legalized sports gambling. In recent years several other states, including California, Hawaii, and Illinois, have considered legislation to allow it. And last month voters in Massachusetts approved a measure that would allow casinos in the state to offer sports betting.</p>
<h1 id="Sports-Wagering-on-the-Verge-of-Becoming-Legal-in-New-Jersey"><a href="#Sports-Wagering-on-the-Verge-of-Becoming-Legal-in-New-Jersey" class="headerlink" title="Sports Wagering on the Verge of Becoming Legal in New Jersey"></a>Sports Wagering on the Verge of Becoming Legal in New Jersey</h1><p>On June 7, 2018, the New Jersey Senate voted to pass a bill that would legalize sports wagering in the state. The vote was 27-13, with one abstention.</p>
<p>Governor Phil Murphy has said he would sign the bill into law, which would make New Jersey the third state in the US to offer legal sports betting, after Nevada and Delaware.</p>
<p>The bill would allow Atlantic City casinos and racetracks to offer sports betting. Monmouth Park Racetrack in Oceanport has already announced plans to start taking sports bets on July 1 if the bill is passed.</p>
<p>“Today is a great day for the people of New Jersey and especially those who enjoy gambling on sporting events,” said State Senator Jim Whelan (D-Atlantic).</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill say that it could lead to more gambling addiction and other social problems.</p>
<p>If Governor Murphy signs the bill into law, betting on sports will become legal in New Jersey by the end of July.</p>
<h1 id="New-Jersey-Poised-to-Win-Battle-over-Sports-Wagering"><a href="#New-Jersey-Poised-to-Win-Battle-over-Sports-Wagering" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey Poised to Win Battle over Sports Wagering"></a>New Jersey Poised to Win Battle over Sports Wagering</h1><p>Governor Phil Murphy has repeatedly stated his intention to legalize sports betting in New Jersey, and it appears he is on the verge of making good on that promise. On Monday, the US Supreme Court announced that it would not hear an appeal from the four major professional sports leagues and the NCAA seeking to overturn a lower court ruling allowing New Jersey to proceed with its plans.</p>
<p>The news was cheered by Governor Murphy, who issued a statement saying, “I am thrilled that the Supreme Court has sided with New Jersey and struck down the federal ban on sports betting. This is a great day for the people of New Jersey and for our economy, as we prepare to reap the benefits of this new industry.”</p>
<p>The decision clears the way for New Jersey to become the first state to offer legal sports betting, although other states are also likely to move quickly to take advantage of the ruling. In addition to earning tax revenue from sports betting, supporters say that it will also create jobs and boost tourism.</p>
<p>Opposition from the professional sports leagues had been a major roadblock to legalizing sports betting in New Jersey, but with that hurdle now out of the way, Governor Murphy is expected to sign legislation authorizing it very soon.</p>
