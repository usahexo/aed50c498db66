Gambling income includes winnings from lotteries, horse races, and casinos, as well as any cash or merchandise prizes awarded in connection with a game or contest. However, taxpayers can deduct their gambling losses on their federal income tax return.</p>
<p>Let’s say you go to the casino and gamble away $1,000. You would report the $1,000 in gambling income on your tax return. But you can also deduct your $1,000 in gambling losses from your taxable income. This could lower your tax bill and save you some money.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you can only deduct your losses up to the amount of your gambling income. So if you lose $2,000 at the casino, but only have $1,000 in gambling income, you can only deduct $1,000 of your losses.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure if something is considered gambling income or a deductible loss, contact a tax professional for help. And be sure to keep track of all of your gambling receipts and records so that you can accurately report your losses (and wins!).</p>
<h1 id="How-To-Claim-Gambling-Losses-On-Your-Tax-Return"><a href="#How-To-Claim-Gambling-Losses-On-Your-Tax-Return" class="headerlink" title="How To Claim Gambling Losses On Your Tax Return"></a>How To Claim Gambling Losses On Your Tax Return</h1><p>Gambling can be a fun way to pass the time, but it can also be costly. If you’re like most people, you probably don’t keep track of your gambling losses throughout the year. However, you can still claim them on your tax return. Here’s how:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Determine your total gambling losses for the year. This includes both money and items that you lost while gambling.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Subtract your total gambling wins from your total gambling losses. This will give you your net gambling loss for the year.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Report your net gambling loss on Schedule A of your tax return. You will need to attach a statement that explains the nature of your losses.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Claim your deduction as an itemized deduction on Line 28 of Schedule A.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Gambling losses are deductible up to the amount of your gambling income for the year. So, if you only had $100 in gambling income for the year, you can only deduct $100 in losses. If you have more than one source of gambling income, you will need to apportion your losses among the different sources.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about claiming gambling losses on your tax return, please contact our office.</p>
<h1 id="Documenting-Gambling-Losses-For-Tax-Purposes"><a href="#Documenting-Gambling-Losses-For-Tax-Purposes" class="headerlink" title="Documenting Gambling Losses For Tax Purposes"></a>Documenting Gambling Losses For Tax Purposes</h1><p>If you’re like most people, you enjoy a little gambling here and there. Whether it’s playing the slots at your local casino, betting on the horses, or playing poker with friends, gambling can be a fun and exciting way to pass the time.</p>
<p>But what happens when you start to lose money gambling? Do you have to report those losses on your tax return?</p>
<p>The good news is that yes, you do have to report gambling losses on your tax return. But the bad news is that it can be a bit complicated to do so.</p>
<p>That’s because the IRS doesn’t specifically recognize gambling as a form of taxable income. Instead, gambling losses are treated as any other ordinary loss incurred during the year.</p>
<p>This means that you can deduct your gambling losses from your other taxable income, just like you would for any other ordinary expense. So if you had $5,000 in taxable income last year but also lost $2,000 gambling, you would only have to pay taxes on $3,000 of your income.</p>
<p>There are a few things to keep in mind when deducting your gambling losses:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can only deduct losses up to the amount of your winnings. So if you won $1,000 at the casino but lost $2,000 while playing blackjack, you can only deduct $1,000 of your losses.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You must itemize your deductions in order to claim gambling losses. This means that if you take the standard deduction instead of itemizing, you cannot claim any losses from gambling.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gambling does not include activities like buying Lottery tickets or raffle tickets. These are considered entertainment expenses and are not deductible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Reporting your gambling losses can be a bit tricky, but it’s important to do so in order to get the most out of your tax refund. If you have any questions about how to report your losses correctly, be sure to consult with a tax professional.</p>
<h1 id="IRS-Provides-Guidance-On-How-To-Report-Gambling-Winnings-And-Losses"><a href="#IRS-Provides-Guidance-On-How-To-Report-Gambling-Winnings-And-Losses" class="headerlink" title="IRS Provides Guidance On How To Report Gambling Winnings And Losses"></a>IRS Provides Guidance On How To Report Gambling Winnings And Losses</h1><p>In Notice 2019-11, the IRS provides guidance on how to report gambling winnings and losses. The notice applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017.</p>
<p>The following is a summary of the guidance provided in Notice 2019-11:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Gambling winnings are generally taxable and must be reported on your tax return.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gambling losses are deductible, but only up to the amount of your gambling winnings.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You must itemize deductions in order to claim a deduction for your gambling losses.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you have both gambling winnings and losses, you must reduce your taxable income by the amount of your gambling losses.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can’t use Form 1040A or Form 1040EZ to report gambling winnings and losses. You must use Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Checklist-What-To-Know-About-Recording-Gambling-Losses-On-Your-Tax-Return"><a href="#Checklist-What-To-Know-About-Recording-Gambling-Losses-On-Your-Tax-Return" class="headerlink" title="Checklist: What To Know About Recording Gambling Losses On Your Tax Return"></a>Checklist: What To Know About Recording Gambling Losses On Your Tax Return</h1><p>Tax season is a time of year when many people scramble to gather the documents they need in order to file their returns. If you’re a gambling enthusiast, you’ll need to be especially diligent in tracking your losses. Here’s a checklist of what you need to know about recording gambling losses on your tax return.</p>
<ol>
<li>You can only deduct gambling losses if you itemize your deductions.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you choose to take the standard deduction when you file your taxes, you cannot deduct your gambling losses. In order to itemize your deductions, you will need to fill out Schedule A and attach it to your 1040 tax form.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Gambling losses are deductible up to the amount of your winnings.</li>
</ol>
<p>This means that you can only deduct the amount of money that you lost while gambling during the tax year. If you won $500 at the casino but lost $600, you can only claim a deduction for $500. Any losses beyond that amount will not be deductible.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>You must have documentation to support your gambling losses.</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to claim gambling losses on your tax return, you will need to provide documentation that supports your claim. This could include receipts from casinos, statements from online betting sites, or wagering logs maintained by yourself or a third party. Without this documentation, the IRS may not allow you to claim the losses on your return.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Gambling income is taxable income.</li>
</ol>
<p>This means that any money that you earn from gambling activities is subject to federal income tax. In addition, most states also levy taxes on gambling income, so make sure that you factor this into your calculations as well.</p>
